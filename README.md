Why Use Conventional Commits
Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
Triggering build and publish processes.
Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.

How should I deal with commit messages in the initial development phase?
We recommend that you proceed as if you’ve already released the product. Typically somebody, even if it’s your fellow software developers, is using your software. They’ll want to know what’s fixed, what breaks etc.

Are the types in the commit title uppercase or lowercase?
Any casing may be used, but it’s best to be consistent.

What do I do if the commit conforms to more than one of the commit types?
Go back and make multiple commits whenever possible. Part of the benefit of Conventional Commits is its ability to drive us to make more organized commits and PRs.
